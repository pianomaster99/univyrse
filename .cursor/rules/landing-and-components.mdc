# Landing Page and Components

- **Use components**: Build the landing and other UI from reusable components (e.g. Button, Card, Badge, sections). Do not inline large blocks of JSX in the page.
- **No backends that don't exist**: Do not call or create API routes, server actions, or backend services that are not already in the project. Use hardcoded or local state only for landing/marketing content.
- **No new backends**: Do not add new backend features, API routes, or server-side logic for this work. Keep changes to frontend components and pages only.
- **Copy**: Avoid em dashes in marketing copy; use commas or rephrase instead.
- **Region**: Messaging should reflect that Univyrse supports applicants worldwide, not only specific countries.
- **Public site**: Do not link to a Design System page from the public website (footer, nav).
- **Review before implementing**: Get a general understanding of the design and existing code before writing code.
